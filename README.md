# MYSQLite

In this project I want to sharpen my Java skills, aswell as my understanding of databases and compilers.
I am following the tutorial published by [cstack](https://github.com/cstack/db_tutorial) on Github.

## Status
Currently I am working on a tokenizer and parser for simple SQL Select-Statements. 

**Note** that the method "private Object[] parseWord(String word)" of each DFA soon will be replaced by a lexical analyzer implementation.
